Bubble is a tablet app designed to aid children's wellbeing by helping them reflect and understand their thoughts and feelings.
    <br> 
    <br>
Both adults and children can use Bubble! Children are encouraged to log their emotions and optionally engage in a breathing exercise whilst adults have access to view their little one's logs in both graphical and written format.
