<h2 align="center"> BootCamp Kitchen <br> Find 15 Minute Meals. Fast. </h2>

---

<p align="center"> 
A desktop and mobile friendly app for boot-campers to use for their food needs. It aims to take the mental load of decision making and time it takes to create meals away and give them back more time to utilise elsewhere.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

"The intense nature of this course has had a negative impact on the average bootcampers eating habits."

This a problem because it can have greater implications to their health; mentally and physically. Skipping meals, convenience ready meals, takeaways, restrictive time forcing boot-camper sinto bad food decisions mean they can miss out on nutrition, which can affect a bootcampers focus and concentration and create a negative cycle.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Team discussions talking about our progress on the bootcamp & experience sharing problems we face and it eventually lead down the path talking about food, how that one hour lunch goes quickly when we have to make our lunch too, a team member stated they often have cereal as quick means to an end. We kind of came into agreement that we all tend to eat not so great since the start of this course along with the other problems. And this lead to the theory we wanted to test out with other bootcampers. Do they feel the same way?

Our User Research lead us to:

- Majority believe a healthy, balanced meal will leave them feeling ready to learn.
- Simple, easy recipes and within minutes 15 minutes
- Meal prep is mostly done the night before or morning off.

Which ultimately proved diet has changed since the boot camp - so how can we get it back?

## üõë Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- This was all built in a week, with only about 2 days to code, we have boiled down this app to it's very essence, henceforth large features such as a login were not included.
- No web frameworks, we're used to build this; it is built with vanilla HTML5, JS & CSS. Scalability is extremely limited.
- In it's current state, the app depends on an external site. This depedency means if that site was to go down then our app would be unusuable.

## üíª Setting Up A Local Enivronment <a name = "getting_started"></a>

We created this project under one repo, splitting back-end and front-end into 2 separate folders. Using package.JSON to set-up scripts to run unit testing and playwright. As this was a vanilla project, we used live preview and extension from VSCode to view the project and inspecting the page to adjust any changes to the front-end build.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In the next few days...

Addressing the dependability concern, we would extend the cards and build in the recipe, make a more complete app.

In the next few weeks...

Expand the database inclusive of more dietary choices i.e. breakfast/desserts and requirements. Creating variety, gives users choice and more reason to keep the user coming back to the app.

Add another CRUD function, that would align with another feature e.g. allowing the user to edit a recipe to tailor it to their requirements and preferences.

Continue testing - cover error handling and more UI & Unit testing.

In the near future...

We want to implement the following features, to make this app into a hub for all user needs:

Account for Login
Search Filters to get users preferences by cuisine, allergies, protein choice
Cart feature to turn into a meal prep plan that would show the list of ingredients and quantity for the week.
Favourites section
Community area, to share pictures, meal idea, comments for quick substitutes and interaction between users.

## üè´ Lessons Learned <a name = "lessons_learned"></a>

- This was a great project to understand project structure, and how to use GitHub a lot more!
- Good planning, teamwork and organisation in general goes a long way and then the code basically writes itself.
- This project further solidified knowledge of JS, semantic HTML & CSS!
- BootStrap is a great way to implement CSS styling, a handy tool in the limited time that we had.
- Understating about the architecture of a full-stack app starting with a the visual aspect.
- Playwright testing - check for the box rather than the content. We don't want brittle tests!
- Energisers are important for morale and can help with overcoming problems!
