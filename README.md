## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

"The intense nature of this course has had a negative impact on the average bootcampers eating habits."

This a problem because it can have greater implications to their health; mentally and physically. Skipping meals, convenience ready meals, takeaways, restrictive time forcing boot-camper sinto bad food decisions mean they can miss out on nutrition, which can affect a bootcampers focus and concentration and create a negative cycle.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>



## 🛑 Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- This was all built in a week, with only about 2 days to code, we have boiled down this app to it's very essence, henceforth large features such as a login were not included.
- No web frameworks, we're used to build this; it is built with vanilla HTML5, JS & CSS. Scalability is extremely limited.
- In it's current state, the app depends on an external site.

## 💻 Setting Up A Local Enivronment <a name = "getting_started"></a>

We came to an agreement to have weekly deploment aligned with each sprint, a production branch called "dev" acted as production branch before each deploment to ensure the app works and looks as intended. This was a vital step into detecting any errors, bugs and ultimately gaining feedback. Using Next as our React App, we had a development server that helped with 
the build that was accessed using "npm run dev" in the terminal (a default script in the package.json to run Next dev).
